    ///    reflected first.

    /// With the current implementation (which, as far as I can determine,
    /// is otherwise correct), the original definition would require
    /// inverting `refout` values for all the documented specifications
    /// if we want the implementation to emit the same check values.

    /// `refin` unequal to `refout`, so verification is hard.
